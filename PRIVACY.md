# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Introduction

Interval Walk Trainer ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Android application.

## Information We Collect

### No Personal Data Collection

Interval Walk Trainer does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal information. The app operates entirely offline and does not connect to any external servers or services.

### Local Data Storage

The app stores the following preferences locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences:

- **Theme Preference**: Your choice of dark or light theme
- **Vibration Setting**: Whether vibration notifications are enabled
- **Voice Setting**: Whether voice notifications are enabled

This data is stored only on your device and is never transmitted or shared with us or any third parties.

### Runtime Data

During app usage, the app temporarily stores timer state (current interval, time remaining, phase) in memory. This data is not persisted and is cleared when you close the app or reset the timer.

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

- **VIBRATE**: Used to provide vibration notifications during interval phase changes. This permission does not collect or transmit any data.
- **POST_NOTIFICATIONS**: Required on Android 13+ to display system notifications. The app only shows timer-related notifications and does not collect data through notifications.
- **WAKE_LOCK**: Used to keep the timer running accurately when your device screen is locked. This ensures the timer continues functioning in the background without collecting any data.

## Third-Party Services

Interval Walk Trainer does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app does not integrate with social media platforms or other external services.

### System Services

The app uses the following Android system services, which are provided by your device's operating system:

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Used for optional voice notifications. TTS is a system service that runs locally on your device. We do not have access to any data processed by TTS.
- **Vibration Service**: Used for vibration notifications. This service operates locally on your device.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Data Security

Since the app does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to personal information. All local preferences are stored securely on your device using Android's standard secure storage mechanisms.

## Children's Privacy

Interval Walk Trainer does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we do not collect any data, the app is safe for users of all ages.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. All app preferences stored locally on your device can be cleared by uninstalling the app.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app's support channels or GitHub repository.

For support or privacy-related inquiries, please open an issue on the app's GitHub repository or contact the developer through the contact information provided in the Google Play Store listing.

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy laws
